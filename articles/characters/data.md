The landmark trial established:
- Data is a person, not property
- Sentience creates rights
- Intent and consciousness matter
- Slavery applies to artificial beings too

## Technical Achievements

2. **Growth**: Evolved beyond his programming
3. **Sacrifice**: Willingness to die for others
4. **Heroism**: Saved the Enterprise and crew countless times
5. **Humanity**: Achieved his goal not through emotions, but through choice

## Data's Paradox

The beautiful irony of Data:
- Wanted to be human
- Already demonstrated the best of humanity
- Lacked emotions but showed great compassion
- Couldn't feel but cared deeply
- Sought what he already possessed

## Final Assessment

Data achieved his goal of becoming human not when he installed the emotion chip, but through his:
- Loyalty to friends
- Sacrifice for others
- Pursuit of knowledge
- Capacity for growth
- Moral courage
- Compassion for all life

In seeking to become human, Data showed us what humanity truly means. He was never "just" an android - he was one of the finest officers to ever serve in Starfleet and a person in every meaningful sense.
